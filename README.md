## ðŸ“° News
* `2025/06/15` ðŸ”¥ Our datasets are available on [ðŸ¤—Huggingface](https://hf-mirror.com/datasets/ltxBIT/MA_CBP_dataset/tree/main)!
* `2025/05/27` ðŸ”¥ Our paper is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06189)!


## âœ¨Highlights
* We propose a pioneering early warning framework for criminal behavior based on LLMs, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that fail to simultaneously achieve deep understanding of historical behavior semantics and meet the requirements for practical deployment.

* We propose a real-time reasoning agent, which performs joint short-term and long-term inference by integrating historical summaries with current visual information, and generates structured decisions regarding potential criminal behavior.

* We have constructed a high-quality criminal behavior dataset that covers four categories of abnormal events and includes fine-grained natural language annotations, providing strong data support for research on criminal behavior prediction.
